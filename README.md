# scheduler-java

I'm using Cron Scheduler for this simple project, and I also use ElephantSQL to provide cloud PostgreSQL Database to test this project. I have already provided the data inside.

I'm using the scheduler to update a person's attendance using a stored procedure (function) by counting the days the person attended in a certain month.

You can create the database tables and data using the SQL script I provided.
